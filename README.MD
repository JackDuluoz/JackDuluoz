## Hi I'm Michael <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

I'm Michael Green, a Full Stack Web Developer living in British Columbia, Canada. I'm new to the tech game in October 2022 and graduated from Lighthouse Labs in February 2023. I worked in store management in the retail grocery industry for a decade before leaving to complete my MBA. During this time I discovered my passion for tech and decided it was time for a change!

  More About Me :)
</summary>

<br >

I love continuous learning and collaboration. I'm always happier working on a project with others and I get the greatest joy from building something cool together. I know there'll always be something else I can learn in tech and that's what excites me the most about the industry. Goodbye boredom!

Although I now live in Vernon, British Columbia, I'm half Australian, half British, having grown up in Melbourne, Australia, and spent a decade in the UK.

While in the UK I hiked from the top of mainland Scotland (John o'Groats) to the bottom of England (Land's End) over three very cold months in the Autumn/Winter of 2010-2011 -- a distance of just under 2000km. It's still the greatest thing I've done in my life and at some stage I intend to hike the Welsh coastal path and do a hike in Ireland/NI as well. My love of long-distance hiking began in the national parks of Britain and has never left me.
